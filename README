#functions:
#spi.configSPI(mode,max_clock,device)
#    takes SPI mode, clock rate, and device path (eg /dev/spidev0.1 )
#    If system defaults are okay then no need to call configSPI
#spi.readwriteSPI(tx_data,device)
#    takes a device path, and an array of numbers interpreted as bytes
#    writes bytes and returs the same number of read bytes from spidev
#see code comments for more details
